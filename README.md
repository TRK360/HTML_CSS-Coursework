# HTML_CSS-Coursework
This repository is a construct of a series of projects that I have worked on during my time at The Tech Academy.  Within it, you'll see examples of Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS files.  In addition to that, you'll see a sample of a live website available for anyone to view, it is a portfolio page demonstrating non-code related projects as well.
